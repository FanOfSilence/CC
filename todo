// What to do here?
// Blocks without return have to jump out of their block
// Blocks with a return take care of themselves
// Who should keep track of the labels?
// BStmt could send in a label to a block but how will it know that it is used?
// Option 1: BStmt creates a new label and stores it for the context. Use TypeChecker to see that the block returns in all paths
// Option 2: Update context to say if the label was used.

//TODO1: First pass to add all global variables (the strings)
//TODO2: Give each new block an option to branch to a label
//TODO3: Make sure that every function has a return
//TODO4: Probably have to branch on empty statement as well
//TODO5: Do alpha renaming so that all testcases can pass. Only variables (not functions) need to be renamed but make sure they are renamed globally and not just per function
//TODO6: Implement missing expressions correctly
//TODO7: Find a way to do lazy evaluation of || and &&
